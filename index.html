    <h1>Welcome, Test Subject!</h1>

  <section class="content" id="about">
    <h2>Portal</h2>
    <p>Portal begins very segmented, each puzzle is unmistakably separate from the last, making it very obviously tapping into the subconscious human instinct associated with Freud's Fort-Da. These tests have very clear structure and point. You must simply get through the exit. As the player completes them, they slowly become more and more complex, while remaining intuitive. They stay easy to digest while remaining difficult enough to challenge you. As you progress the tools at your disposal increase but are kept limited which promotes the players critical thinking more than their capacity to navigate an arsenal of tools.  </p>

  
    <section class="content" id="about">
    <h2>Sound</h2>
    <p>This game has no theme. The majority of the game lives within the ambient sounds of the laboratory occasionally interrupted by a robotic voice on the intercom. That isn't to say there is no music. Throughout your journey you pass by the occasional laboratory radio, each playing the same comically and uncomfortably positive song on loop.</p>

    
    <section class="content" id="about">
    <h2>The World</h2>
    <p>Throughout the first 15 tests, the world felt small. The extent of our insight into the world we’ve been playing within is confined to the test chambers of a laboratory. And has been routinely guided by only a robotic voice. Cold, untrustworthy, and until this point seemingly omnipotent, the voice reassures us like cattle with words from a script. The voice, over and over, promises you cake once you finish your tests. You are trapped. </p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Test Chamber 16
        <ul>
          <li>
            This test chamber begins with the robotic voice informing us that this chamber is not a chamber for testing the portal gun (which we have obtained and managed to unlock its full power), but a chamber for testing military turrets. This chamber is arguably the most important chamber in the game. It is without question a suture moment and is chalk full of text-book examples of Barthes’ “reality effect”. The first thing you find yourself doing is grabbing a turret. And in a way similarly human-ish to the main robotic voice, the turret begins to speak. Still robotic, but hyper aware of its circumstances. It is surprised by you grabbing it from behind. It yells confused for help as it flails on the floor after being thrown on its side, unable to ground itself before malfunctioning and shutting off. There was even a moment where I used one turret to shield myself from another, and the turret called out to the other saying “WAIT! ITS ME!”. These little details are effective in displaying the idea that these robots have grown beyond the code they were originally given. They’ve gone rogue. Whoever originally designed them, is no longer maintaining them. They’ve evolved. 

Another important moment is at the end of this chamber where one of the panels used as wall, ceiling, and floor throughout the chambers has been propped open by testing cubes. Just outside the opening to the room behind the panel is our first sign that others have been here. A handprint and the word ‘help’ written in red on the white tile of the test chamber immediately set a new tone. The room behind the panel is a huge contrast to the clean chambers we’ve seen so far. All the questions, uncertainty, and suspicion created in the first 15 chambers are made real in this dirty, abandoned factory room with walls full of chicken scratch that read “the cake is a lie” over and over. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Test Chamber 19
        <ul>
          <li>
            After a few more eerie and even saddening chambers (I highly recommend you play the game yourself to understand what I mean) you have reached your last chamber. You make your way to a platform that turns a corner and presents a furnace room that is meant to be your demise. Your usefulness has run dry. In this moment, your death drive is meant to take over and lead to your escape. This is the turning point of the story. You’ve broken free. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Breakout
        <ul>
          <li>
            The voice immediately displays both an affect and an emotional reaction to your escape. The voice's internal and instinctual response is a confused and angry “WHAT!?”. Moments later the voice regains its composure and chooses to approach the situation with lies. In this moment the voice becomes real. It has been lying all along. 

The puzzles become less distinct from one another as you are no longer using an elevator to get to the next area. The rundown factory behind the walls of the test chambers is liminal, lifeless, and boundless. No one has been here in a long, long time. Your enemy is the cold brutalist laboratory itself.  
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The End
        <ul>
          <li>
            The robot talks every moment of your fight with it. It never ceases its slander. It never ceases its petty lies. And in its last moments, it tells you that the place you have been escaping the entire time is the only save place left in the world. The last safe place from “them”. And the game ends.
